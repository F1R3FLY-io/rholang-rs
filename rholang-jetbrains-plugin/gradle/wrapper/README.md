# Gradle Wrapper

This directory should contain the Gradle Wrapper JAR file:
- `gradle-wrapper.jar`

If this file is missing, you can generate it by running:
```
gradle wrapper
```

Or download it manually from:
https://github.com/gradle/gradle/raw/v8.0.0/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar

The Gradle Wrapper allows you to run the build without having Gradle installed on your system.
